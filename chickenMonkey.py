# 1. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. You can use Python's range() to quickly make a list of numbers.
for i in range(1, 101):
    print(i)

# 2. For multiples of five (5, 10, 15, etc.) print "Chicken" instead of the number

# 3. For the multiples of seven (7, 14, 21, etc.) print "Monkey".

# 4. For numbers which are multiples of both five and seven print "ChickenMonkey".

# 5. To determine if a number can be evenly divided by 5 or 7, use the Python modulo operator.
